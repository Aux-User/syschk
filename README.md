# syschk
Similar to the bash script in [statrep](https://github.com/Aux-User/statrep), this is a python script that displays    
- OS type and version
- Private IP, public IP and default gateway addresses
- Hard disk size, used and available space
- Top 5 directories and size
- CPU usage with refresh rate of 10 seconds

This script was written as part of my Python Fundamentals module that I took for class.    

The expected result when run on a Linux system will be as follows
